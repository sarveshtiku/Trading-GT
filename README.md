# Georgia Tech Trading Club ‚Äì Equities Commentaries Archive

This repository curates weekly equity market commentaries developed for the Georgia Tech Trading Club during Spring 2025. Each report offers sector-specific insights, notable stock movements, and thematic market observations across key industries including Technology, Utilities, Consumer Discretionary, Staples, Energy, Financials, and Health Care.

## üìà Process

Each commentary followed a consistent weekly workflow:
1. **Sector Selection** based on macro trends or unusual ETF/stock activity (e.g., XLK, XLU, XLY).
2. **Data Sourcing** from Yahoo Finance, Finviz, and earnings releases.
3. **Charting** done using a custom Python script (`Equities-Graph.ipynb`) to visualize sector ETF movements and YTD trends.
4. **Writing & Synthesis**: Commentary includes sector performance, standout tickers, drivers of movement, and forward-looking context.
5. **Internal Distribution** to club members followed by external publishing on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tradingclubgt/).
