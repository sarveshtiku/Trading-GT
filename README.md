- **Consumer Discretionary (XLY)** — E-commerce strength versus brick-and-mortar softness; inflation-sensitive spending cycles  
- **Consumer Staples (XLP)** — Defensive positioning, pricing power in inflationary environments, demand inelasticity  
- **Energy (XLE)** — Oil-price catalysts, geopolitical supply shocks, and the fossil-fuel-to-renewables pivot  
- **Financials (XLF)** — Interest-rate risk, bank-earnings outlook, and regulatory developments in credit markets  
- **Health Care (XLV)** — Pharma resilience, med-tech headwinds, and investor rotation inside a defensive sector
